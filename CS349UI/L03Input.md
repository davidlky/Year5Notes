## L03, Input

Dimensions of Classifying Computer Input
- Sensing Method
- Continuous vs Discrete
- Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
- Type of Data Managed

Better to be specific or general?

### Text Input

QWERTY meant to space things out to prevent jamming
- uneven(more left than right)
- jumps and same fingers etc.

Unicode and ASCII were limited towards english only
- Unicode is super set of ASCII
- UTF-xx, xx being min bits

Keyboards need to be downsized or reduced, interfering with efficiency

Virtual Keyboard has problem, missing feedback and tiny keys
- benefit of customizability and portability

Chording keyboard, really cool

Map strokes to letter, natural handwriting etc.

predict input (predictive text)
- T9 inputs
- autocomplete

Gestural typing - faster

### Positional Input
Properties
- force vs displacement sensing
  - force: joystick
- position or rate
  - rate: joystic
- absolute vs relative
  - touchscreen: abs
- direct vs indirect
- DOF sensed

Isometric (Force) vs Isotonic (displacement)

Position Control and Managing Coordinates
- Cartesian coordinates vs computer
  - (0,0) is easier

Clutching
- relative position needs clutch (repeatedly move) to get to target
  - one of the ways

CD Gain (Control-Display)
- ratio of display pointer to device control pointer
  - scale basically, in terms of velocity

Pointer Acceleration
- dynamically change based on velocity, reduce need to clutch

## L4, Output
Relationship between external stimuli and internal sensations

Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) -> 45

Motion Blur sometimes used to make things look real

spatial resolution of visual processing system
- 6m, needs 1/60 degrees
- used for getting the right ppi

Retina display: iphone X -> 461 ppi, 10-12 inches away
15inch MB -> 220 ppi

Colour perception
- 2 light sensors: Cones (color and help focus) and Rods (light vs dark -> peripheral)

3 types of Cones: Trichromatic Vision
- RGB (red is almost yellow)

Color Blindness
- monochromacity: 2-3 cones missing
- dichromacy: 1 type of cone missing
  - prot-anopia -> red
  - deuter-anopia -> green
  - tri-anopia -> blue

Hard to discriminate color based on presentation
- hard to distinguish based on paleness, size, and distance

Color models:
- RGB (additive)
  - displays
- CMYK (subtractive)
  - print

HSV
- Hue: color
- Saturation: how much hue, compared to white
- Value (Brightness), how much light

Color Harmony:
- complementary (high contrast)
- analagous (pleasing)
- triad: vibrant (balanced)

Set each pixel individually, coordinate system

- 3 pixels of RGB

LCD
- Liquid Crystal Display
- Liquid will bend so polarization picks up

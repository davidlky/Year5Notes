## L07, Widgets

UI Widgets
- Widget is a generic name for parts of interface that have own behavior (aka components)
- provide feedback and captures input, have appearance, send/receives input

Logical Device: what widget does (its function)
- widget is logical device with appearance

Categories
- does it contain other widgets? container vs simple

Widget Functionality
- logical input device: categorize based on behavior
- also: 
  - State: what data does it store
  - Events: what does widget generate
  - Properties: how should it be presented (location, size, visibility, enabled)

Again, high level vs low level toolkits/libraries/gui libraries

Design Goals: Completeness, Consistency, Customiability
- make more customizable, expose hiarchy, plugin for behavior and etc.

JFrame/JDialog -> JPanel -> JLabel/JButton

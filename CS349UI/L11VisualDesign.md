## L11, Visual Design

UI Visual Design Objectives

1. Information Communication

- enforce designed relationship
- make all valid action clear
- provide consistent, meaningful and timely feedback

2. Aesthetics
3. "Brand"

Impose as little thinking as possible

Structure needs to be designed, people will look for structure even when there is none!

Gestalt Principles - impose a structure instead of making them figure it out!

- Theory of visual perception that describe how people organize visual elements
- Proximity
- Similarity (size, shape color)
- Continuity (we like continuous things)
- Closure (percieves a set of individual elements as a single recognizable pattern)
- Connectedness (connected via lines, regions seems more related)

Creating Organization and Structure

- Grouping, Hierarchy, Relationship (use position and size), Balance (lmao dont resize), Simplicity, Clarity (typography)

Typography:

- Originally, the typeface is a particular design of type, while a font is a type in a particular size and weight. In short, a typeface usually gathers many fonts.
- Kerning: spacing of the extra Figature/ascender being overlapping (yes is applied so less space)

- Usability vs Usefulness
  - Usability: effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction which users achieve tasks with
  - Usefulness: meeting specific needs and supporting real tasks.

User Mental Model

- What the user believes about the system
  - Frequently, mental model is not accurate or complete compared to the system model (provided by the device/design)

3 Models of a System

- Developer's Model: how believes the system be used
- System Model: how does the system work
- User: how user believes the system is used
- Developer and User communicate via the system

Don Norman's Model of Interaction

- Execution: what we do to system to achieve goal
  - form intention, plan, the execute
- Evaluation: compared what happened to what we wanted.

  - perceive state, interpret perception, evaluate

- We do something, then we evaluate if it did what we thought it did

Gulf of execution: hard to translate intention to actions allowed

Gulf of evaluation: hard to determine state of system and if goal is met

Central Tension:

- UI: mediate between a creative and rich varied user vs a structured and rigid system

Principles that reduces the Gulfs

- Percieved Affordance - what you then you can do with an object based on what you see (based on history and cultural background)
- Mapping - mimic a real life result and the movement of control
- Constraints - prevent certain things
- Visibility/Feedback- aim for feedback ith every action, only relevant part should be visible
- Metaphor - unify concepts and borrow concept from another domain
  - use common language, analogues

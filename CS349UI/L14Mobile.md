Why Touch?

- Saves space!

Mobile Devices:

- limited resources, primarily touch based, mobile form factor

Design is about Constraints

Mobile Design:

- limited processing capabilities
- Single App
- Primarily full screen with sequence of sreens
- Responsiveness

Surface Capacitance: use current and sensors at corner to localize touch

Projective Capacitives

- electrodes in a grid -> capacitor at each wire intersection (measure at each intersection)

Touch vs Pen:

- Contacts, Precision, Hand, Input, Intermediary, Buttons, Force

Expand gesture with time/contact based gesture (even voice etc.)

- gestures aren't intuitive or discoverable

Touch target needs to be large (because people have fat fingers)

Challenge:

- no hover state
- multi touch dispatch ambiguity (what constitutes as an action what should be sent)
- Physical (small device, what if reaches border? solved with elastic input)

Android:

- Enchant Me: people like moving real objects
- Simplify My Life: know where i am, if it looks the same then should do the same
- make me amazing: be nice, make important things first

Help user find right actions

- Highlight important things first (FAQ, unread)
- Make it obvious distinguish between control and content

Avoid Clutter

Responsiveness:

- User Expectations
- Application Design

Responsiveness is the most important factor of determining user satisfaction!

- Not the same as performance

Responsive: give a lot of feedback and allow for other tasks while waiting, await most common requests

Continuous Input: less than 10ms

Cause and Effect: less than 140ms

Fake it till you make it fam (show a fake image)

Progress Indicator:

- show work remaining, show total progress when multiple steps
- display finished state at the end (dont skip 100%)
- show smooth progress
- use human language

Medium that photo (low res to then high res!)

Responsiveness by Predicting next operation

- Prefetch linked pages

Simplify feedback for high computation tasks! (dragging complex window, do draw call at the end)

Chunk processing (word by word vs letter by letter)

Threading to provide better performance, most UI tools like Swing is not thread safe!

- use `syncronized` for thread safety! - accessed by 1 thread at a time!

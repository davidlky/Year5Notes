Model of how people use devicies and interfaces

- focused on time and error, easy to measure

KLM - Keystroke Level Model

- describe each task with a sequence of operators, sum it up
- K -> keystroke, P -> pointing, B -> button press, H -> hand move from mouse to keyboard, M ->mental preparation
- K for each letter!

- Mental Operations
  - M when people have to
    - initiate a task
    - make a strategy decision
    - retrieve from memory
    - find something on display
    - think of a task parameter
    - verification
  - Add more M for novice!

Drawbacks of KLM: out of date data some times, sometimes variable,

- does not model error and learning time!
- pointing to diff location takes diff time!

Fitt's Law

- predictive model for pointing time considering device, distance and target size
- support different pointing devices

Movement Time is porportional to Distance/Size

$MT=a+b\log_2(D/W+1)$ ^a, b are characteristics of input device, W is the size of the target, D is the distance

b -> index of performance (1/b)

ID -> (D\W+1) index of difficulty

for 2D, W is the mimimum target (min(W, H))

Pie menu is better than contet menu as all items are D away (context have some closer than others)

Fitts's law says that the os doc expanded target is no easier than default!

Fitts law, if calculated in motor space, then if a button is "sticky" and slower to go through, would increase its size hence be better. (move slower over button -> motor space)

Steering Law

- Adaptation of Fitts' law
- Constraint path takes longer!

Essentially, will sum parts of a path (through a context menu for instance!)

Manipulate motor space!

### Review

1. What is the difference between an interface and an interaction?

- External presentation vs. actions by user and system over time

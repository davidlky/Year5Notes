Agent perform actions to affect the enviornment
- makes decisions based on abilities, goals/prefernces, prior knowledge, stimuli and past experiences

Knowledge Representation - Symbol Systems
- Symbol is a meaningful physical pattern that can be manipulated
- Symbol system: create, copies, modifies and destroys symbols
- Physical Symbol System Hypothesis:
  - a PSS has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action
    - AI on computer is possible in theory, but not feasible in practice

Good representation:
- Expressive, close to problem (compact and maintainable), amenable to efficient computation, amenable from more input

Decision making for AI
- Abilities: what can it do
- Observations: direct input from environment
- Prior Knowledge: knowledge base when developed (map, capabilities)
- Past Experiences
- Goals

Dimensions
- Research leads to simplifying assumptions and reducing them
  - each simplification leads gives a new *dimension*
    - can be multiple values - simple to complex values
    - combine these assumptions

Middle ages start when Roman Empire ends to the renaissance (500 - 1500~ish)
- Europe in transition period
- look at the decline of society - Romans

the most recent sustainable Western society
- after which its mostly constant growth outside their ecological boundaries

Christianity the biggest influence, church the biggest employer in middle ages

Rome
- 759 BC Traditional date of the foundation of Rome
- 510 BC Rome becomes an independent city-state and begins her conquest of the Italian peninsula
- By 115 BC Rome has defeated the Carthaginians and Macedonians and is a great Mediterranean power

- 43 AD  Roman forces invade Britain and overrun southern third

64 AD - Great Fire
- 9 days, Nero sees fire and blames Christians
  - people thought Nero was to blame, so he found a scapegoat
  - Christians was an easy scapegoat, prosecuted
    - did not want to acknowledge Roman gods, minority etc.
    - more and mor martyrs after prosecution, grows in followers over time in the future

Rome is built on expansion, new resources and people (slaves)
- 45-60 million people

3rd century
- army started revolting with people supporting army leader
- short period of peace, lots of infighting
- many incompetent rulers that were "barrack emperors"
- lack of competent army with discipline
- Rome began to lose the borders and Germans, Persians attacked
  - not enough men to protect themselves

Volkerwandurung (migrations) of the German tribes continue on a massive scale
- "Barbarian" raids & invasions increase and Rome can only "react" to them
- some German invasions even reached Italy
- Rome begins to solve manpower needs by employing Germans in all branches of the military
  - started to assimilate them and give them land

- high, unfair taxes & rampant inflation, Financial collapse
- Increasing concentration of wealth, Typical of despotic cronyism
- End result: ~1,500 families controlled >90% of the wealth
- Combination of courtiers & urban sophisticates
  - Wealth crosses religious boundaries

Cities became bankrupt
- infrastructure broke down, no more maintenance
- people are deincentivized for civil order and infrastructure

Eventually
- depopulation by famine, war and plague
- Social dislocation (loss of civic pride)
- robber bands on the rise
- Germans (Alemanni, Franks, Jutes, Saxons, Goths, Burgundians, Vandals, etc) begin a long series of raids and invasions too numerous to list 
- Each of these areas fed into each other and created a cycle of  social, economic, political and military chaos and decline

Coins before Diocletian easily breakable - inflation because people minted new coins from od ones (chipping pieces into new coins)

Romans

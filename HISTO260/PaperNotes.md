-	Eusebius was baptized and ordained at Caesarea, where he was taught by the learned presbyter Pamphilus, to whom he was bound by ties of respect and affection and from whom he derived the name “Eusebius Pamphili” (the son or servant of Pamphilus), he was then prosecuted and died for it (his teacher)
-	a fully documented history of the Christian church, and, at worst, collections of passages from his sources
-	Eusebius, however, was not a great historian. His treatment of heresy, for example, is inadequate, and he knew next to nothing about the Western church.
-	Eusebius and two of his allies, Theodotus of Laodicea and Narcissus of Neronias in Cilicia, were provisionally excommunicated for Arian views. When the Council of Nicaea, called by the Roman emperor Constantine I, met later in the year, Eusebius had to explain himself and was exonerated with the explicit approval of the emperor.

- It has been said that all other church historians begin where Eusebius of Caesarea leaves off.
- His Ecclesiastical History, written during the early fourth century, covers one of the most important periods in Christian history: from the birth of Christ to the time of Constantine the Great.
- Because much, if not most, of this material is now no longer extant, the service rendered by Eusebius to later generations lies in his extensive quotations from such works.
  - he has a lot of good quotes, although "lacking critical judgment and literary style"
- But his history is very one-sided. He used the resources at his disposal to focus attention on the church he saw as the true descendant of first-century Christianity. (Ecclesiastical History)
- Given the changes brought about within the empire by Constantine, Eusebius also wanted people to recognize the emperor as a champion of that church. In fact, all of his writings, whether historical or biographical, are written to establish the Catholic church as the church of Constantine.
- That they became friends, however, is suggested by several references to Eusebius being invited to the palace to dine with the emperor.
- usebius came to see himself as a spiritual advisor to Constantine. The relationship also led to a posthumous biography, Eusebius’s Life of Constantine, generally considered a panegyric; that is, a highly flattering account of the emperor’s life.

- On meeting the emperor, Eusebius clearly became an admirer, later writing Vita Constantini, or Life of Constantine. 
- As bishop of Caesarea, Eusebius cast Constantine as very pro-Christian and proclaimed him the first Christian emperor. In the bishop’s view, the kingdom of God had been established with the advent of this emperor—a view that was further developed by subsequent generations of church historians. 
-  Panegyrics, prevalent in the empire, extolled the virtues and exploits of an emperor or ruler but often without regard to fact or reality. 
-  Eusebius’s is not the only chronicle of the illustrious emperor’s life, however. The Christian West has largely overlooked the numerous histories and accounts by profane, or secular, writers both during and after his life. 
   -  presented an opposing view of Constantine’s religious sentiments to that of Eusebius, even after the empire professed Christianity
-  Despite his supervisory role in the Council of Nicea and his self-appointed role as bishop, Constantine postponed his baptism until 337, when he was on his deathbed. 
- we might rather conclude that Constantine used Christianity to serve his own purpose of unifying and controlling his empire.
- Constantine made his Roman Christian church hostage to the state so that now it would serve the needs of emperor and empire.

- in fact, he encountered Constantine but rarely, and his information about his emperor is mostly secondhand.

- In the introduction and commentary to their translation, Averil Cameron and Stuart G. Hall show a keen interest in the parallels between Constantine and Moses and even call these parallels “the most obvious device used by Eusebius in the Life of Constantine to bring home his ideological message.”

- this man was Eusebius, writing the Life of Constantine within three years after his death 
- This Life is especially valuable because of the account it gives of the Council of Nicæa and the earlier phases of the Arian controversy. It is well to remember that one of our chief sources of information for the history of that council is a book written to magnify Constantine.

- whose Ten Books of Histories (often wrongly called The History of the Franks) is the major 6th-century source for studying the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks.
- Gregory’s family was prominent in both religious and political affairs. On his father’s side he claimed descent from Vectius Epagathus, a martyr in the persecution at Lyon in 177. 
-  Gregory also claimed to be related to 13 bishops of Tours and to many senators (though the latter term is ambiguous).
-  he wholeheartedly promoted the cult of St. Martin, about whom he wrote four books of “miracle stories.”
-  The bishop’s criticism of Chilperic’s queen, Fredegund, was exploited by Gregory’s enemies, and he was tried for slander at the council of Berny-Rivière in 580. 
-  Gregory is best remembered for his writings, especially his Histories, on which he worked until shortly before his death. Although he insisted that all 10 books be transmitted together, an abridged version of the first 6 circulated in the 7th century. For many years scholars mistakenly believed that version had been prepared by Gregory.
-   Gregory’s Histories provide invaluable insight into the political life of his age, and his hagiographies illuminate the age’s religious and social life, especially the cult of saints in Merovingian Gaul.
-   his writing differed radically from classical Latin in spelling and case endings
-    Gregory’s works are carefully constructed and rhetorically sophisticated, conveying profound religious and spiritual messages.

- In his writings he complains of his ignorance of the laws of grammar, of confounding the genders, employing the wrong cases, not understanding the correct use of prepositions, and the syntax of phrases, self-reproaches that need not be taken too seriously. 
- He undertook with great zeal the heavy task imposed on him. In the near past King Clovis had both used and abused his power, but his services to the social order and the fame of his exploits caused the abuses of his reign to be in great part forgiven.
- Clovis died before he was born
-  Gregory relates, indeed, as stated above, the story of his age, but in the narrative he himself always plays a prominent part.
-   He tells a plain unvarnished tale of what he saw and heard. Apart from what concerns himself, he always tries to state the truth impartially, and in places even attempts some sort of criticism.

- Although raised a pagan (according to some historians, he would be the last of the pagan kings), Clovis realized that a conversion to Christianity would be extremely beneficial to him if he ever hoped to secure the loyalty of all of the Frankish people. 
-  According to Gregory of Tours, his conversion came, in part, due to his marriage to the Burgundian princess Clotilde (daughter of Chilperic);
-  According to the historian Roger Collins, however, Gregory should not be completely trusted in his account. Collins writes, "Unlike the reign of Theodoric, there is very little strictly contemporary evidence for that of Clovis" and further notes that the evidence which is available "makes it virtually certain that Clovis was a Christian by around the year 486 CE" (110). 
-  Even if he is viewed by some as unreliable, Gregory of Tours is one of the few sources on the reign of Clovis and his conversion to Christianity. 
-  His conversion, administered by the bishop of Reims, would not only ensure the loyalty of the conquered provinces but also recognition by Anastasius, the emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, who was as interested in the success of those who shared his brand of Christianity as he was in the downfall of those who did not.

- However although Gregory was relating history mainly contemporaneous or recent, we must allow largely for error and prejudice in his statements of fact.

- For the earlier part of the work he depended on various chronicles, histories and local annals, and also on oral tradition.
